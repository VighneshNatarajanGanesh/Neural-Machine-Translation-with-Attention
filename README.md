# Neural Machine Translation

This notebook will talk about 
* Building a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25"). 
* this will be done by using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models. 

This notebook is derived from the MOOC course [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) by deeplearning.ai
